Hi! This post is just made to test Jekyll, but I'm going to leave it publicly visible anyways. My partner's parents took me out for dinner last night, I ordered a big leg of lamb. It was coated in this sauce, I think it was cranberry? Berry sauces are something I've never experimented with at home, I'm curious about trying some now. Maybe with raspberries or some freshly picked wild berries? Something to explore; I should check when DC's berries come into season.
